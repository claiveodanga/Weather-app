This code is a weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API.

To use this code, you will need to get an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Once you have your API key, you can paste it into the `apiKey` variable at the top of the code.

The code uses the `fetch()` API to make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API. The `fetch()` API takes two arguments: the URL of the API endpoint and the request body. In this case, the URL of the API endpoint is `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?units=metric&q=` and the request body is the city name.

The `fetch()` API returns a Promise, which is a JavaScript object that represents a future value. When the promise is resolved, it will return a response object. The response object contains the data that was returned from the API.

The code uses the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to be resolved. Once the promise is resolved, the code parses the response object and gets the weather data for the city.

The weather data is then displayed on the page. The city name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed are displayed in the `.weather` div. The weather icon and condition are displayed in the `.weather-icon` div.

If the city name is not found, the code displays an error message.
